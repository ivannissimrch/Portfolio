## About Me

I specialize in creating web applications using **TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, Material UI, and Tailwind CSS**.  
I've collaborated on several team projects through **Chingu**, including **DevVault, Ember AI, Slice, and Weekly Bytes**, where I've applied **Agile methodologies** and **GitHub Flow** workflow.  

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking trails with my miniature poodle or enjoying Latin dancing.  
I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
